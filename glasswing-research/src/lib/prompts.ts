1. Who are the top 3-5 direct competitors?
2. Why can't a large incumbent (like NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) simply build this themselves?
3. What is this company's defensible moat? (network effects, proprietary data, switching costs, technical complexity, regulatory advantage, speed to market)
4. Where is this company vulnerable?
